# CARDECO - Live more sustainably with every purchase. 
## Overview
CARDECO is a credit card that motivates consumers to make more sustainable decisions. Users can earn additional cash back with every sustainable purchase, see their emissions on a per-purchase and aggregate basis, and compete against users with similar spending habits to get the highest "sustainability score" and earn rewards such as double their cash back at the end of the year. This aims to target issues faced by individuals wanting to live more sustainably: lack of ability to quantify the environmental impact associated with decisions, and lack of motivation.
## Important Features
- **1% additional cash back for any sustainable purchase**
- **Sustainability score** for each user determined by what type of consumer they are (ex. is this an individual/family account, are they more frugal/affluent) and their carbon emissions across purchases
- **Ability to view CO2 emissions** on a per-purchase and aggregate basis
- **Sustainability leaderboard** which allows users to see how sustainable they are in comparison to users with similar spending habits, and motivates them to make better choices so they can earn rewards
- Sustainability Dashboard
## Challenges & Next Steps
- We were unable to get the API given to us to work, so we were unable to have any backend to generate CO2 or use to calculate sustainability scores.
- As the prompt of the hackathon was focused on groceries, something we would have done differently in the future was make the product more grocery-focused rather than a credit card, which includes all types of transactions.
- Include initial survey that segments users into a category, and incorporate data analysis as they use the card to see if they would be better fitted for another group
